Hi! I'm Jo√£o Paquim, a software engineer from Lisbon. In my spare time I like to learn new things, write code, and play the guitar, piano, and synthesizers.

You can find the source code for this website and some of my other projects at my [GitHub](https://github.com/jpaquim). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpaquim/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/jpaquim), and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jpaquim).
