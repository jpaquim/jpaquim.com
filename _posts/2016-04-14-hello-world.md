and welcome to my blog and personal website.

# Who am I?
My name is Jo√£o Paquim, and I'm a Portuguese quasi-engineer, musician on my free time.

# What will this be about?
I'll use it to showcase some of my projects, and write about several subjects that interest me, from programming to music. I find that the best way to truly understand something is by trying to explain it, and this will be the main purpose of this blog.

When learning something, I usually write small notes for myself, aggregating content from various resources and adding my own input after experimenting a bit. I figured I might as well expand on the notes, turn them into full-fledged tutorials, and share them with others who might find them useful.

I won't commit to any particular subject, as I frequently get bored and move on to explore different things. Rather than blog-wide cohesion, I'll strive for immediacy, allowing myself to write about whatever excites me at a particular point in time, and documenting my own learning experiences.

My interests are continuously shifting, but include the following:

- Machine learning and data mining.
- Robotics, computer vision,  and control systems.
- Software development, web and systems, open source.
- Physics, maths, dynamical systems, stochastic processes
- Computational science and engineering
- Music production and sound design

I hope you'll find something interesting or helpful for yourself, and enjoy your stay!
